# DesignPattern

### Strategy Pattern ->
Strategy is a BEHAVIORAL DESIGN pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

### Observable Pattern ->
Observer is a BEHAVIORAL DESIGN pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

### Decorator Pattern -> 
Decorator is a STRUCTURAL DESIGN pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
