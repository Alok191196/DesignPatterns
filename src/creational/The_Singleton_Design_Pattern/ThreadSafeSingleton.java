/*
    In Java, the keyword synchronized is used on methods or objects to implement thread safety,
     so that only one thread will access a particular resource at one time.
      The class instantiation is put within a synchronized block
      so that the method can only be accessed by one client at a given time.

      The overhead for the synchronized method is high, and reduces the performance of the whole operation.
